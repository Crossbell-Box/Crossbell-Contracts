[Git Source](https://github.com/Crossbell-Box/Crossbell-Contracts/blob/e766977bdc30280fa526980b0d06830fcccb4412/contracts/misc/TipsWithFee.sol)

**Inherits:**
[ITipsWithFee](/contracts/interfaces/ITipsWithFee.sol/interface.ITipsWithFee.md), Initializable, IERC777Recipient

*Logic to handle rewards that user can send to character and note.*

*The platform can set the commission ratio through the TipsWithFee contract,
and draw a commission from the user's tips. <br>
For `TipCharacter`
User/Client should call `send` erc777 token to the TipsWithFee contract, with `fromCharacterId`,
`toCharacterId` and `receiver`(a platform account) encoded in the `data`. <br>
`send` interface is
[IERC777-send](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc777#IERC777-send-address-uint256-bytes-),
and parameters encode refers
[AbiCoder-encode](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/abi/coder/#AbiCoder-encode).<br>
For `TipCharacter4Note`
User should call `send` erc777 token to the TipsWithFee contract, with `fromCharacterId`,
`toCharacterId`, `toNoteId` and `receiver` encoded in the `data`. <br>
The platform account can set the commission ratio through `setDefaultFeeFraction`, `setFeeFraction4Character` and `setFeeFraction4Note`.*

### tokensReceived

*Called by an {IERC777} token contract whenever tokens are being
moved or created into a registered account `to` (this contract). <br>
The userData/operatorData should be an abi encoded bytes of `fromCharacterId`, `toCharacter`
and `toNoteId`(optional) and `receiver`(platform account), so the length of data is 84 or 116.*


```solidity
function tokensReceived(
    address,
